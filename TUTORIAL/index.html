            <p>
                Welcome to a tutorial intended to strengthen your understanding of some exciting and powerful
                programming concepts.
            </p>
            <h2>USEFUL O.O.P, ANIMATION, AND GAME DESIGN</h2>
            <p class="mag">
                This course is intended to be completed sequentially, starting at lesson one, to the end. Each lesson
                builds upon the last to gradually reinforce and introduce new concepts. There are also additional
                supplementary lessons for various categories. This course can be administered in a classroom setting
                where students are lectured and then split into small groups to complete the challenge at the end of
                each lesson. Or a student may complete it on their own. Either way, don't forget to use your resources.
                That means having dev-docs open all the time, and working with others to solve problems.
            </p>

                WARNING: A basic understanding of JAVASCRIPT is recommended before undertaking this course. This course
                is intended to be friendly to all levels of coder but having a base knowledge of JAVASCRIPT will likely
                make it much more valuable to you.
