            <h1>LESSON 1: INTRODUCTION</h1>
            <p class="mag">
                In this lesson we will learn that learning takes time and dedication. If you want to be a truly bad-ass
                programmer, then you should start with the basics and make sure you have learned them well before moving
                on. Then when you feel you figured it out, start testing the boundaries of your knowledge through other
                people and by implementing concepts into projects, and finally learning new concepts that you feel are
                too difficult to understand. If you do not challenge yourself, you may become stagnant! If you do not
                code after studying, the learning might not stick.

                    It should go without saying that any of the code examples and assets should not be copied directly
                    for the purpose of academic submissions. That being said you are more than welcome to use the
                    knowledge, assets, and small sections of code for your own projects as long as you leave an
                    attribution. Don't take credit for something you didn't create. Odds are that the truth will come
                    out and it will only lead to suffering for you and the people around you. I have no doubt that if
                    you apply yourself, you will be able to create your own original content that you can take pride in.

                    The following lessons, this one included, will end with a challenge. This challenge is intended to
                    be completed using research tools and the lesson articles itself. However, if you find yourself
                    truly unable to complete the challenge, the solution code will also be provided with each lesson. I
                    also recommend that you try to implement the learned concepts into your own project(s) if you have
                    time. This will help reinforce the learning and add value to your own projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are completing challenges as a group, make sure that you save your challenge solution, and
                    the record the members of your sub-group for that lesson.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some challenges may have "starting files", in these lessons you will be need to go into the lesson
                    files associated with this course and lesson and find the one marked "challenge_starting_files". You
                    can code on top of this partially completed project. You may also build upon files from previous
                    lessons instead if you wish.

                    1. If you are going through this course on your own, good for you. You should get comfortable
                    teaching yourself in this field, but if you can, try and bounce some of your learning and ideas
                    against some other people. Verbalizing your thoughts will not only often reveal holes in your logic
                    but also helps cultivate communication skills. Plus it will be expected of you if you are going to
                    work on a development team in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. If you are going through this course on your own, because you already completed this course in a
                    group setting, rock on, try and focus on the things that you had trouble understanding the last
                    time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. If you are going through this course as a group, then you are in luck. The format for group
                    lessons is as follows.

                <p>
                    It is best if sub-groups are small, three students on one computer. Also it is expected that
                    students read through the articles in each lesson, they will likely contain more information than a
                    lecture will provide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The group randomizer in the challenge section of this lesson can be used for selecting sub-groups,
                    or the groups can select themselves. If however the groups select themselves, it is recommended that
                    periodically groups be randomly selected for some lesson challenges. Then students can return to
                    their normal sub-group for the next one. Communication and working with people you may not normally
                    associate with is an EXTREMELY valuable skill, don't forget it.

                    file at the root directory for your project.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Every JAVASCRIPT file in this course will and should have strict mode enabled. As you will see at
                    the very first line of every file exactly.
                </p>
                <pre>'use strict';</pre>
                <p>
                    Strict mode will throw some errors when JAVASCRIPT would normally not. This is good, it will help
                    prevent insidious little bugs that come from minor syntax errors that might have slipped through the
                    cracks otherwise. However it is not a panacea, you must still me mindful to avoid and catch general
                    syntax and semantic errors.

                <p>
                    All of the code associated with this course will adopt the newer async await syntax instead of using
                    the old "Promise.then().catch()" syntax. Coding challenges should be completed using this syntax for
                    async control.
                </p>
                <p>BEFORE ASYNC AWAIT</p>
                <pre>
const before_async = () => {
  
  new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    window.setTimeout(() => resolve(), 3000);
  })
  .then(() => console.log('I WAITED 3 SECONDS'))
  .catch(err => console.error('SOMETHING WENT WRONG', err));
    
};
          </pre>
                <p>WITH ASYNC AWAIT</p>
                <pre>
const with_async = async () => {
  
  try {
    await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      window.setTimeout(() => resolve(), 3000);
    });
    console.log('I WAITED 3 SECONDS');
  }
  catch(err) {
    console.error('SOMETHING WENT WRONG', err);
  }

};
          </pre>
                <p>
                    This syntax may be new to you but it can make complicated asynchronous code much easier to read
                    without changing any functionality. Please read the section in dev-docs related to JAVASCRIPT async
                    await if you are not familiar.

                <p>
                    All of the code associated with this course will adopt the newer JAVASCRIPT class syntax for the
                    purpose of object oriented programming. We will be using them liberally throughout the course. You
                    will learn about classes as the lessons proceed, however, it is advised that you read up on the
                    basics of the syntax.
                </p>
                <a href="https://devdocs.io/javascript/classes" target="_blank">CLASS DOCS</a>
                <br>
                <p>
                    You may come across (much) older code that does not utilize the class
                    syntax for it's object oriented approach but rather the old underlying object methods or syntax.
                    This
                    code will still run and is in fact the the same exact functionality that classes use, just harder to
                    learn.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For simplicity, this course will not be teaching this old syntax, however if you wish to gain a
                    deeper understanding of JAVASCRIPT and how it works "under the hood", you might consider becoming
                    familiar with it after completing this course.

                    Malicious software:<br><br>

                    A computer user can be tricked or forced into downloading software onto a computer that is of
                    malicious intent. Such software comes in many forms, such as viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, and
                    worms.<br><br>

                    Malware, short for malicious software, is any software used to disrupt computer operation, gather
                    sensitive information, or gain access to private computer systems. Malware is defined by its
                    malicious intent, acting against the requirements of the computer user, and does not include
                    software that causes unintentional harm due to some deficiency. The term badware is sometimes used,
                    and applied to both true (malicious) malware and unintentionally harmful software.

                    group at the end. It is up to you whether you choose to have these members split up and join other
                    groups or just stay as a smaller group. Just don't leave anyone by themselves if at all possible.

                <p>
                    Your exercise for this introductory lesson will be different than the ones that will come after.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As one group everyone should take a piece of paper and write down two things on it(in private).
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. What you are most afraid of about learning to become a coder.
                    <br>
                    2. What you are most excited about becoming a coder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now please put them all in a hat or something and shake them up. Have everyone draw a piece of
                    paper, if you draw your own just put it back in the hat and draw a different one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now everyone can read their paper and see how it compares your own fears and excitements. Don't
                    share these or divulge the identities if you know.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is likely that your fears are similar to others fears and you should not feel that you are alone
                    in this journey, we are all on this rock together. Use the very valuable asset that is your peers.
                </p>
                <h4>FOR INDIVIDUALS:</h4>
                <p>
                    On a piece of paper write down two things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. What you are most afraid of about learning to become a coder.
                    <br>
                    2. What you are most excited about becoming a coder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Save this piece of paper, put it somewhere safe. When you are feeling like you are not able to
                    complete a challenging coding task in the future look back on this note and remind yourself how far
                    you have come since then.

            <h2>ADDITIONAL RESOURCES</h2>
            <p>Each lesson will explain and provide research resources for a general concept or skill. It is highly
                recommended that you take the time to review lessons, research subjects, and practice on your own
                between lessons.</p>
            <p>At the end of each lesson will be a challenge, completing these assignments is paramount to your
                retention of the taught material. The struggle is where the learning really occurs, embrace it.</p>
