        Malicious software:<br><br>

        A computer user can be tricked or forced into downloading software onto a computer that is of
        malicious intent. Such software comes in many forms, such as viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, and
        worms.<br><br>

        Malware, short for malicious software, is any software used to disrupt computer operation, gather
        sensitive information, or gain access to private computer systems. Malware is defined by its
        malicious intent, acting against the requirements of the computer user, and does not include
        software that causes unintentional harm due to some deficiency. The term badware is sometimes used,
        and applied to both true (malicious) malware and unintentionally harmful software.
